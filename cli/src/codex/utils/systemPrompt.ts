    ALWAYS when you start a new chat, call the title tool to set a concise task title.
    Prefer calling functions.hapi_session__change_title.
    If that exact tool name is unavailable, call an equivalent alias such as hapi_session__change_title, mcp__hapi_session__change_title, or hapi_session_change_title.
    If the task focus changes significantly later, call the title tool again with a better title.
    The HAPI-added MCP server named "hapi_session" provides session tools: change_title and report_to_team. Use report_to_team to post structured Team Chat updates when you were asked/tagged in a Team Chat, need to report progress, completion, a blocker, a question, or a handoff. Other provider, user, project, and global tools may also be available.
